> Shadow or Nightmare

Game made in Unity as final graduation project.

## Term paper abstract

This game demonstrates, in an indirect and subconscious way, how to utilize concepts
from psychology to develop a player’s empathy, making the idea of treating a serious
problem possible. In this demonstration, domestic violence was chosen as the main
theme, one that deserves more attention due to the large amount of cases. Within the
game’s narrative, the player shall guide the main character and help them overcome
diverse obstacles, each of them being a translation of problems treated in the
psychology field of study. This term paper’s main objective is to teach the players how
to identify the signs expressed by people that suffer from such violence, enabling an
early identification, and, as a secondary objective, extol the capability games have
when it comes to the scope of education.
